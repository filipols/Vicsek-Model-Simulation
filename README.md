# Abstract

This project delves into the dynamics of building evacuations through agent-based simulation,
utilizing the Vicsek model. The study addresses the critical relationship between evacuation time,
stress levels, and the number of individuals, challenging conventional assumptions such as the
faster-is-slower effect and Yerkes-Dodson’s Law. Surprisingly, the simulations reveal that higher
stress levels lead to shorter evacuation times independent of the number of individuals, contrary to
traditional expectations.

The simulation model incorporates nuanced factors, including stress-induced changes in decision-
making, clustering effects, and cognitive impacts on evacuation dynamics. The study conducts
a short analysis, exploring the interplay of these elements in emergency scenarios. Notably, the
findings emphasize the intricate nature of stress dynamics during evacuations, highlighting the
need for further research.

Recommendations for future work include fine-tuning simulation parameters to better align
with real-world scenarios, as well as simulating even higher stress levels and more realistic building
layouts. Adjustments such as optimizing stress levels, refining clustering factors, and setting
chaos thresholds aim to enhance the model’s accuracy and predictive capabilities. This research
contributes valuable insights to the refinement of building safety protocols, ultimately elevating the
effectiveness of emergency evacuations.
